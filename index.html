  	  <h1>right column</h1>
  	  <h1> Figure 1 </h1>
  	  <h2> Marks </h2>
  	  <ul>
  	  			<li> Area: Each state on the map </li>
  	  			<li> Area: Electoral vote bar at the top</li>
  	  			
  	  </ul>

  	  <h2> Channels</h2>
  	  <h3> Color </h3>
  	  	<ul>
  	  		<li> Represents the attribute of hue </li>
  	  		<li> This is good mapping because the high contrast of the red and blue create visual pop out & is a color-blind safe combo </li>
  	  		<li> Also shows the grouping of results, with red and blue individually being one category, and mixed states showing both </li>
  	  	</ul>
  	  <h3> Size </h3>
  	  <ul> 
  	  	<li> Represents the area attribute </li>
  	  	<li> This is mostly good mapping, because while the states are recognizable, the size of the states don't indicate the number of votes, and some of the states 
  	  	aren't proportional to the rest, such as Alsaka </li>
  	  </ul>

  	  <h2> Colormaps </h2>
  	  <h3> Identity Channel</h3>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li> This identity channel is categorical </li>
  	  	<li> This is good mapping because the red and blue are very perceptually different for their own category with no overlap</li>
  	  	<li> They have the same saturation and value </li>
  	  </ul>

  	  <h1> Figure 2</h1>
  	  <h2> Marks </h2>
  	  	<ul>
  	  		<li> Points </li>
  	  		<li> Lines: Represents where the points lie, such as 25 Line drives</li>
  	  	</ul>

  	  <h2> Channels</h2>
  	  <h3> Position </h3>
  	  <ul> 
  	  	<li> Represents the attributes of both x and y value </li>
  	  	<li> This is good mapping because it is showing the combined effect of 
  	  	of exit velocity and launch angle </li>
  	  </ul>
  	  <h3> Color </h3>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li> Represents the hue and saturation </li>
  	  	<li> This is good  mapping because it represents a scoring value, has orange and purple being at opposite ends of the spectrum with a middle neutral value </li>
  	  	<li> Both colors are color-blind safe </li>
  	  </ul>

  	  <h2> Colormap </h2>
  	  <h3> Magnitude Channel </h3>
  	  <ul> 
  	  	<li> This channel is divergent with ordered attributes </li>
  	  	<li> This is good mapping because it uses orange and purple to represent the opposite side of spectrum with cream being the "average" </li>
  	  </ul>

  	  <h1> Figure 3 </h1>
  	  <h2> Marks </h2>
  	  <ul> 
  	  	<li> Lines</li>
  	  </ul>
  	  <h2> Channels </h2>
  	  <h3> Position </h3>
  	  <ul> 
  	  	<li> Represents both the horizontal and vertical attributes </li>
  	  	<li> This is helpful because the relationship in a visually clear way </li>
  	  </ul>
  	  <h3> Color </h3>
  	  <ul>
  	  <li> Color (hue) attribute </li>
  	  <li> Each color represents a specific group which makes it easier to seperate and associate to the reader </li>
  	</ul>
